      Step 3: Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat it with cooking
      spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles
      form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and
      cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
